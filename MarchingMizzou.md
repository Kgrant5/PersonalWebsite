# Marching Mizzou
The Southeastern Conference has long been known for fielding many of the finest marching bands at the collegiate level, and the University of Missouri, one of the leading educational and research institutions in the world, is no exception. Marching Mizzou, also known as the “Big ‘M’ of the Midwest,” has grown over its 135-year history to be the most visible and largest ensemble in the School of Music. Although many of its core members are music majors, Marching Mizzou boasts an even higher number of students representing nearly every discipline across campus. In the fall of 2020 84% of the membership of Band 135 consisted of non-music majors.

Marching Mizzou advances into its second century with a time-honored tradition of excellence that combines quality musicianship, spirit, and pride to create their nationally renowned excitement that blends the great traditions of the University of Missouri with the exciting performance styles of today. With powerful music, creative show designs, and a marching style that is clean, precise, quick moving, and entertaining, Marching Mizzou continues to captivate audiences of all ages at football games, parades, and performances both domestic and abroad, rightfully taking its place among the nation’s oldest and finest university band programs.

Marching Mizzou has been under the direction of Dr. Amy M. Knopps, Associate Director of Bands and Director of Athletic Bands and Dr. Pete Zambito, Assistant Director of Athletic Bands since 2017. In the fall of 2020, we welcomed Dr. Christan Noon, Assistant Director of Bands to the School of Music and Marching Mizzou faculty.
